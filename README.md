## A Library of AngularJS Components Implementing Boostrap 4
### _Tomorrow's Library with Yesterday's Framework_

Just because you use AngularJS and not Angular like all
the cool kids, does'nt mean you can't look good!
Enjoy the robust styling architecture of
the new [Bootstrap 4](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/),
while still using good ol' [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

## Alternatives
* Still used to bootstrap 3.x? Use [UI Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)
* Finally upgraded to Angular? Use [NG Bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home)
* None of the above? You belong with us!
