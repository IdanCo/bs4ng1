## A Library of AngularJS Components Implementing Boostrap 4

Just because you use AngularJS and not Angular like all
the cool kids, doesn't mean you can't look good!

Enjoy the robust styling architecture of the new [Bootstrap 4](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/),
while still using good ol' [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/).

See it in action at https://idanco.github.io/ng1bs4/.

## Alternatives

* Still used to Bootstrap 3.x? Use [UI Bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/)
* Finally upgraded to Angular? Use [NG Bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home)
* None of the above? You belong with us!

## Install

[Install bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/webpack/) and import it's JS and styling into your project.

Install _ng1bs4_

```sh
npm install ng1bs4 --save
```

Import `ng1bs4` module and styling into your project

```js
import ng1bs4 from 'ng1bs4';
import 'ng1bs4/dist/import.css'
```

Inject `ng1bs4` module into your app

```js
angular
  .module('myApp', [
    ...,
    ng1bs4
  ]);
```

Test by adding this directive anywhere in your markup

```html
<ngbs-test></ngbs-test>
```

for more details checkout a [sample project with angularJS, bootstrap4 and ng1bs4](https://github.com/IdanCo/webpack-modular/tree/ng1bs4).


## Philosophy

**No Styling**. We believe you should be able to customize as much as you want, and with Bootstrap 4 theming is easy! That's why all components include minimal styling and rely heavily on Bootstrap's native classes and variables.

**Simple Code**. We strive to keep all components as simple yet robust as possible. Hence, rewiring them to fit your needs should be easy peasy.

## Create Components

Development is easy and fun! Just follow these simple steps to get started:

1. Have at least [Node.js 6.x](https://nodejs.org/) installed
1. Fork [the main repository](https://github.com/IdanCo/ng1bs4)
1. Git clone the forked repository
1. Run the following commands
    1. `npm i`
    1. `npm run serve`
1. Open http://localhost:8080 in a browser
1. Start making amazing changes!

Create new components easily with our generator! simply install [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), and inside the project folder type
```sh
yo ./generators/component
```
And follow the on-screen instructions. Created a cool component? Make a pull request and contribute it back.
